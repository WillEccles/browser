# VB.NET Browser
Browser I made in VB.NET as a final project for a class. Very old project, only just now uploading it. Just found it again for the first time in 2 or 3 years.

## Some info
- Yes, I know it's based on IE. I'm sorry web devs, I feel your pain.
- Yes, most lines are explained in comments. Since it was for a class, the teacher made me comment all the things. I hate it as much as anyone else does.
- I was going to rewrite this in C#, but that never happened. Too lazy. Who cares, if you want to use IE you can just use IE.
